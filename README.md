**ML Classifier Applications on Word2VecData**

#Introduction 
For this report we will focus on using pre-recorded data to make predictions on whether a review will be positive or negative. To achieve this, we will use multiple machine learning classifiers that will use a text embedding dataset, which is essentially a series of vectors acquired from the word2vec model, and categorize it based on the vectorâ€™s specifications. In order to minimize data discrepancies or biases, the data was split into a training and testing set, where we will use the training data to predict the testing data. Some of the classifiers utilized include: K-Nearest Neighbor, Perceptron, Logistic Regression and SVM.
